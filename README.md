# PhySim

I worked on some physics home work once, but got pretty bored. So I though, why not create a physics engine? I love Programming... and Physics. And here it is PhySim, the worlds first physics (and possibly game) engine created by ***me***.

This project turned out a bit chaotic. There were multiple issues.
  * First off it was my first attempt at writing something in TypeScript and my knowledge from other languages could only take me so far.
  * In addition I didn't know a lot of the maths involved and only had a pretty basic understanding of it

To fix this I started watching some tutorial videos about the maths involved:
  * 1
  * 2
